README for test/GCHPctm (GEOS-Chem integration test directory)

===============================================================================

Overview:
---------

This directory contains scripts to submit automated GCHP integration
tests, which will test the following process:

1. GCHP run directory creation
2. GCHP code configuration and compilation
3. GCHP execution

Integration tests are mostly intended to be run by GEOS-Chem developers,
rather than end users. Driver scripts in this directory are customized
for use on the Harvard Cannon cluster.


Files:
------

# Driver script to run GCHP integration tests (compiles and executes GCHP)
intTest_slurm.sh

# Supporting scripts
intTestCompile_slurm.sh    : Script to only compile GCHP
intTestExecute_slurm.sh    : Script to only run GCHP
commonFunctionsForTests.sh : Bash script with reusable functions
intTestCreate.sh           : Script to create GCHP run directories to test

Instructions to run integration tests:
--------------------------
Execute the following commands at the Unix prompt from within the GCHP code:

    On Harvard Cannon cluster:
    -------------------------
    cd test
    ./intTest_slurm.sh /path/to/integration/test/dir /path/to/gchp/env/file

NOTES:
- The first argument is the directory where you want all GCHP
  integration test directories and files to be stored.
- The second argument is a GCHP environment file that loads libraries.
- For debugging you can add an optional third parameter debug=1,
  which will run integration tests for two run directories.  This is useful
  for development & debugging.
