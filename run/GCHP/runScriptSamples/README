# Example Run Scripts

This folder contains:

(1) template file 'gchp.batch_job.sh' to adapt for submitting GCHP batch
    jobs for various schedulers (PBS, LSF, and SLURM)

(2) template file 'gchp.local.sh' to adapt for running GCHP on the command line

(3) subdirectory 'operational_examples' containing job scripts used regularly on
    specific systems (Harvard Cannon, NASA Pleiades, and WUSTL Compute1).

If you are running GCHP on a system in 'operational_examples' then you can copy and
adapt a job script from that folder. If you are running on a different system then
you should copy and adapt one the template files.

If you have a working run script on a system with several GCHP users please
consider submitting it to the GEOS-Chem Support Team for inclusion in
'operational_examples' in a future version. This will make it easier for users on
your system to get started with GCHP.
